    "titleHighlight": "AI Agents",
    "description": "Your agents need API keys — they don't need the keys to the kingdom. Authy is a CLI secrets manager with encrypted vault, scoped policies, run-only tokens, and full audit trail. Agents inject secrets into subprocesses but never see the values. Single binary, no server, no accounts.",

    "title": "Built for the Agent Age",
    "description": "Traditional secrets managers weren't designed for AI agents. Claude Code reads .env files silently. OpenClaw stores API keys in plaintext. HashiCorp Vault requires a server. Authy gives agents scoped access with run-only enforcement — they inject secrets into subprocesses but never see the values.",
    "encryptedVault": {
      "title": "Encrypted Vault",
      "description": "Single age-encrypted file using X25519 keys or scrypt passphrases. Secrets stored in MessagePack format for speed. All data encrypted at rest with modern cryptography. No metadata leakage."

      "title": "Scoped Access Policies",
      "description": "Glob-based allow/deny rules per agent scope. Define exactly what each agent can access. Policies stored inside the encrypted vault — tamper-proof by design. Deny overrides allow, default deny for security."

    "sessionTokens": {
      "title": "Run-Only Tokens",
      "description": "HMAC-SHA256 validated tokens with run-only enforcement. Agents can inject secrets via authy run but cannot read values directly. Short-lived with configurable TTL, scannable authy_v1. prefix for leak detection, and instant revocation."

      "title": "Subprocess Secret Injection",
      "description": "Inject secrets as environment variables only into the child process. In run-only mode, this is the only way agents can access secrets — get, env, and export are blocked. Zero trace after process exit."

      "title": "Config File Resolution",
      "description": "Replace <authy:key-name> placeholders in any config file with real values from the vault. Templates are safe to commit. Resolve at deploy time with authy resolve. Works in run-only mode."
