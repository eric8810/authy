    "description": "Your agents need API keys — they don't need the keys to the kingdom. Authy is a CLI secrets manager with encrypted vault, scoped policies, run-only tokens, and full audit trail. Agents inject secrets into subprocesses but never see the values. Single binary, no server, no accounts.",

    "description": "Traditional secrets managers weren't designed for AI agents. Claude Code reads .env files silently. OpenClaw stores API keys in plaintext. HashiCorp Vault requires a server. Authy gives agents scoped access with run-only enforcement — they inject secrets into subprocesses but never see the values.",

      "description": "Single age-encrypted file using X25519 keys or scrypt passphrases. Secrets stored in MessagePack format for speed. All data encrypted at rest with modern cryptography. No metadata leakage."

      "description": "HMAC-SHA256 validated tokens with run-only enforcement. Agents can inject secrets via authy run but cannot read values directly. Short-lived with configurable TTL, scannable authy_v1. prefix for leak detection, and instant revocation."
